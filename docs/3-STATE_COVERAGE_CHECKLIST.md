## Accountability Framework

### Session Start Protocol (MANDATORY)
Every session MUST start by reading this file and reporting:
1. States at PRODUCTION: X of 55
2. States at PARTIAL: Y of 55
3. Total matches in system
4. What was accomplished last session (from Progress Log)
5. What's next per Wave priority

### Session End Protocol (MANDATORY)
Every session MUST end by:
1. Updating this file (status changes, checkboxes, progress log)
2. Committing changes
3. Reporting delta: "+X matches, +Y teams, Z states moved up"

### Wave Discipline
Follow Wave order (2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9) unless user explicitly redirects. No jumping ahead.

### "Am I Drifting?" Check
Before ANY task: "Is this the highest-ROI activity per Wave priority?" If no → redirect.

---

## Verification Checklist (Per State Onboarding)

When bringing a new state to PRODUCTION, verify ALL THREE data flows:

```markdown
## State: _______ | League: _______ | Date: _______

### Flow 1: Match Results → SV Power Rating
- [ ] Adapter scrapes match results correctly
- [ ] Matches flow through staging → DQE/fastProcess → matches_v2
- [ ] Teams resolve correctly (source_entity_map populated)
- [ ] ELO calculation includes new matches
- [ ] Teams appear in state rankings with correct state

### Flow 2: League Standings → AS-IS Display
- [ ] Adapter scrapes standings correctly
- [ ] Standings flow through staging_standings → processStandings → league_standings
- [ ] Divisions display correctly in app
- [ ] W-L-D and points match official league data (NOT recalculated)
- [ ] All teams in each division visible (no NULL metadata filtering)

### Flow 3: Scheduled Games → Upcoming Section
- [ ] Adapter returns future matches with NULL scores
- [ ] Matches have league_id linkage (required for app_upcoming_schedule)
- [ ] Upcoming games appear on team detail pages
- [ ] NULL scores preserved through pipeline (not converted to 0-0)

### Regression
- [ ] Zero impact on existing state data
- [ ] Total teams_v2 count only INCREASES
- [ ] Total matches_v2 active count only INCREASES
- [ ] GotSport rankings unaffected
```

---

## Notes

- **NO LEAGUE states (MS, SD, WY):** No statewide premier league structure. Teams compete in multi-state USYS conferences. Captured through conference events on GotSport.
- **EDP states (NJ, PA-E, NY, MD, DE, CT):** Use GotSport under the hood via EDP Soccer.
- **California:** Split into 3 sub-regions (Cal North, NorCal Premier, Cal South) — independent league admin.
- **Pennsylvania:** Split into 2 (Eastern PA via EDP/GotSport, PA West via SportsAffinity).
- **Sports Connect:** Being sunset 2027, migrating to PlayMetrics. States tracked under PlayMetrics going forward.
- **Squadi:** Australian platform recently entering US market (AR, NJ).
