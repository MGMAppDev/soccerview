## Key Marketing Messages

### 1. ELO Rating Credibility

**Core Message:** "SoccerView Power Rating uses the same ELO methodology adopted by FIFA for World Rankings"

**Why it matters:** Parents and coaches instantly recognize FIFA. This builds trust without requiring them to understand the math.

**Talking Points:**
- FIFA adopted ELO in 2018, replacing their old points system
- Same mathematical foundation used by FiveThirtyEight for sports predictions
- Originally developed for chess — proven over 60+ years
- Wins against stronger teams count more than wins against weaker teams
- Fair comparison across regions and leagues

**Where to Use:**

| Touchpoint | Suggested Copy |
|------------|----------------|
| App Store description | "SoccerView Power Rating uses the same ELO rating system adopted by FIFA for World Rankings — your kid's team, rated like the pros." |
| App Store subtitle | "Youth Soccer Rankings • FIFA-Style Ratings" |
| Help/FAQ section | "Our Power Rating uses ELO, the same mathematical system FIFA adopted in 2018 for ranking national teams. It's also used by FiveThirtyEight, chess federations worldwide, and major esports leagues." |
| First-time tooltip | "Power Rating uses the same system as FIFA — beating strong teams counts more." |
| Social media | "Your kid's team, rated like the World Cup 🏆" |
| Website hero | "The rating system trusted by FIFA. Now for youth soccer." |
