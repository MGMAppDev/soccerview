      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where does the ranking data come from?</h3>
        <p>
          SoccerView features two ranking systems: Official Rankings sourced from
          GotSport national rankings, and our SoccerView Power Rating which uses
          the same ELO methodology that FIFA adopted for World Rankings. Both are
          updated daily from official match results.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How often are rankings updated?</h3>
        <p>
          Rankings and match data are refreshed every night. Your team's latest
          results are typically reflected within 24 hours of being reported by
          the official source.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I can't find my team. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>
          Try searching by your team's club name and filtering by state, age
          group, and gender. SoccerView covers over 100,000 teams across all 50
          states. If your team still doesn't appear, it may play in a league we
          haven't added yet. Email us and we'll look into adding coverage for
          your league.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do match predictions work?</h3>
        <p>
          Our AI-powered prediction engine uses six factors to predict match
          outcomes: ELO rating, goal differential, win rate, championship
          history, head-to-head record, and match experience. Predictions include
          a confidence score and detailed factor breakdown.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is SoccerView free?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! SoccerView is completely free with no ads. We believe every soccer
          family deserves access to quality team data.

          SoccerView is built by a youth soccer parent who wanted better tools to
          track his kid's team. Every feature exists because a real soccer family
          needed it.
