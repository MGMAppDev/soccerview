2. READ CLAUDE.md Critical Principles section (Principles 1-41).
3. Check git status below for uncommitted work from previous sessions.
4. If uncommitted changes exist, address them FIRST before starting new work.
5. Ask user for current priorities before starting new work.
6. Data bugs → fix data layer. UI bugs → get explicit user approval first.
7. Every fix must be UNIVERSAL (all affected records), not specific (one team).
8. Three-layer verification: Intake → Processing → Presentation.
9. "Events" is banned. Use "leagues" or "tournaments" only.
